The greeter separates users and bots, so you can set up different greetings for each of them
Use `greeter config add u [channel] [text]` to configure a greeting for users
Use `greeter config add b [channel] [text]` to configure it for bots
You can have multiple greetings for each, if they're in the same channel, one random appropriate greeting

Greetings use a small and simple formatting language, that has the following:
`{{name}}` - gets the name of the one that joined
`{{mention}}` - mention version of `$NAME$`
`{{time}}` - current GMT time and date
`{{guild}}` - name of the guild (server)

Example:
If you want to create 2 user greetings in #general, one of which would be randomly selected when someone joins,
and a bot greeting (not really a greeting) in #bots, you would run these commands (in any order): ```
greeter config add u #general Welcome {{mention}}, please have a read of #readme!
greeter config add u #general {{mention}}, you have been randomly selected to be welcome in {{guild}}!
greeter config add b #bots We have a new bot, {{name}}, added at {{time}}
```(by #general, #readme, etc. are meant channel mentions or IDs)
